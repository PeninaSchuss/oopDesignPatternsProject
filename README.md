Xonix game
Introduction to Object Oriented Programming
Final Project

In this project we implemented the Xonix game "Conquering territories", using the SFML library.

The classes in the program and their role:

A department that is responsible for everything related to the game board.
CanMoveToPlace
Department responsible for movement permissions of the enemies. (used for Strategy)
CollisionHandling
A class that manages the collisions in the game. (uses MultyMethod)
Command
Parent class for all menu commands. (Command design pattern)
Controller
A department that manages the game.
Display
A department that wraps images and is responsible for all operations related to them.
DynamicObj
A class from which all moving objects in the game inherit.
Enemies
The enemy class of the game.
EnemyFactory
Department that creates the enemies (Factory pattern)
FreezeEnemiesGift
A gift that freezes the enemies on the board. Inherited from Gift
GameController
A class that runs the game and manages its stages.
Gift
A department from which all gifts are inherited.
GiftFactory
A department that produces a gift in a raffle. (Factory design)
Graphics
The Singleton class, where all the sound textures, etc. are located.
ImmunePlayer
A class that inherits from player, this is an immune player created for a limited time following a collision with a gift that gives immunity.
ImmunityGift
The gift that makes the player immune for a limited time. (inherited from Gift)
InfoOfLevel
A class where the data is stored for each step.
InformationDisplay
A department where everything related to the menu that appears on the board during the entire game is found.
KillEnemyGift
A gift that makes the player become a killing player, and kill all the enemies he collides with. (inherited from Gift)
KillingPlayer
A class that inherits from Player. This is a player kill for a limited time, following a collision with the gift above.
Level
A class that manages the current stage of the game.
LifeGift
Inherited from Gift, a gift that adds life.
Menu
All game menus inherit from this class. (Command)
Move
From this class the displacement classes (Strategy) inherit
MoveEverywhere
A class responsible for moving all the board tiles. Inherited from CanMoveToPlace
MoveToBlocked
A class responsible for moving only the tiles blocked on the board. Inherited from CanMoveToPlace
MoveToUnBlocked
A class responsible for moving only the tiles that are not blocked by the board. Inherited from CanMoveToPlace
NewGameCommand
The command to run the game. Inherited from Command
NoiseCommand
The command to manage the audio of the background sounds in the game. Inherited from Command
Object
A class from which all objects in the game inherit.
Player
The player's department.
RandomMove
The department responsible for random displacement. Inherited from Move
SettingsCommand
The show settings command. Inherited from Command
SettingsMenu
the settings menu. Inherited from Menu
ShowInstructionsCommand
The game instructions display command. Inherited from Command
SimpleMove
A class responsible for simple movement on the board. Inherited from Move
SmartMove
A class responsible for intelligent movement that follows the player. Inherited from Move
StartMenu
The initial menu, inherits from Menu
StaticObj
A class from which all static objects in the game inherit. Inherits from Object
TerritoryEater
An enemy that inherits from Enemies. He is a special enemy that eats occupied territories and makes them empty.

Main data structures and their roles:
We used uniqe_ptr vectors for the enemies and gifts.
We used vector over vector for the board matrix.

Common bugs:
There are no bugs in the program!

Noteworthy algorithms:
We used several design patterns:
We used MultyMethod to manage the collisions.
We used factory+strategy design patterns for building the enemies, which have a pointer for the type of movement. When the move class has an additional pointer for the type of squares the enemy is allowed to move to. (strategy within strategy)
We used the factory design pattern for building raffled gifts during the game.
We used Command within Command design pattern for the primary menu, within which there is a secondary menu of settings.
We used  singleton design pattern for the Graphics class where all Textures, Sounds, the game window, etc. are located. That way everyone knows her and can easily get what they need from her.
In addition, we used the recursive algorithm: FloodFIll for coloring the area occupied by the player.

General Comments:
It is very easy to upgrade the game and add stages.
You can easily create another type of enemies - simply add another class of movement and combine with one of the classes of "on which squares it is allowed to walk", and create the new enemy in facrory.
game rules:
The player's goal is to conquer the requested area at each stage.
He has a number of lives, when they run out and the player is eliminated the game is over.
The reasons that lower a player's life:
 If he meets the enemy (except for those who eat territories).
If he moves on a place that is in the middle to occupy (a place marked with a circle)
If time runs out.

The enemies in the game:
Stupid enemy - travels on the board. On all types of terrain (occupied and not occupied)
Clever Enemy - Chases the player. Travels all over the board.
Ball - its role is to travel only in unoccupied territory. If the player surrounds an area that contains the enclosed area the enclosed area is not occupied.
Eats territories - eats the territories conquered by the player.

Types of gifts:
extra life
extra time
Freezing enemies for a few seconds
A gift that makes the player immune for a few seconds
A gift that makes the player kill all the enemies he encounters (except for the unkillable area food) for a few seconds.
